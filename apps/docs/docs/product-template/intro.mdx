## Motivation

Just make another one template ðŸ¥´

There are already exists many templates that solve different problems,
but I haven't seen any solution that cover whole working process

- documentation for product knowledge base
- libraries setup - publication
- monorepo, integrated with good tooling (NX here)
- **simple** - it's really important, the template should be very easy to use
