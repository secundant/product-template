# Monorepo

As we noted in [Introduction page](./intro), monorepo isn't definitely right solution, much more like a tradeoff.

#### Benefits

- Code structuring and easy reuse - we're able to extract all common logic
  to shared libraries and use it without any painful actions (build/publish/install/update/etc.)
- Consistency
- Collaboration across team and tools

#### Drawbacks

- Requires common smart tools (NX/Turbo/etc.)
- Repository size - this is potential problem with scaling up (**TODO - research it**)
